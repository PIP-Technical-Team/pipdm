  # Note AC: There are some surveys in PFW that are not in the PIP-folder because
  # they haven't been dowloaded. I know that some US surveys haven't been
  # downloaded because I don't have access to the files in DLW. Additionally
  # there were some cases of surveys that were added to PFW, but are not relevant
  # for this update (i.e they are not in DLW yet).
  #
  # Regarding welfare_type: If I remember correctly I decided to just merge on
  # Country, Acronym and Year because of cases like PHL. This should be sufficent
  # since other cases that have mulitiple welfare types for the same year aslo
  # have different survey acronyms (e.g POL). But the whole handling of multiple
  # welfare types in the same survey is probably something we could discuss.
